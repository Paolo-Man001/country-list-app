### Countries in a List
This is a simple Android App written in Java that displays a list of countries using Recycler-View.
Each row of country is displayed with a flag on the left, and the country-name and its capital on the right.
  
This was used for learning how to implement several Android Technologies  
and using MVVM coding architecture as prescribed by Google.  
We also created basic Unit Tests with jUnit and Mockito.

Technologies used:
- Dagger 2 - dependency injection
- RxJava - reactive java framework for asynchronous programming using observables.
- Retrofit and JSON - for remote server/api communication
- Glide - image loading
- Mockito - for Unit-Testing
